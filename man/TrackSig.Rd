\title{Determine a genomic signature profile.}
\usage{
TrackSig(
  df,
  binSize,
  activeInSample,
  sampleID = NULL,
  referenceSignatures = TrackSig:::cosmicV3,
  scoreMethod = "Signature",
  nCutoff = 10000,
  desiredMinSegLen = 1,
  refGenome = BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19::BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{dataframe of mutation counts from which we can fit activity profiles.}

\item{binSize}{number of mutations per bin}

\item{activeInSample}{list of signatures names to fit the exposures of. All listed signatures must be present in the referenceSignatures dataframe.}

\item{sampleID}{name to call sample. If none provided, name will be automatically drawn from the provided vcf file name.}

\item{referenceSignatures}{dataframe containing definitions of mutational signatures.}

\item{scoreMethod}{string to indicate what scoring method to apply when finding changepoints. Default = "Signature"}

\item{nCutoff}{maximum number of total mutations to consider (samples with more than nCutoff muations will be down-sampled)}

\item{desiredMinSegLen}{minimum number of mutations to include in a PELT segment (the desiredMinSegLen will be overridden if there are too few for accurate scoring)}

\item{refGenome}{BSgenome to use as reference}
}
\description{
\code{TrackSig} will take an input CSV file of mutation counts and determine a genomic profile for the sample, based on changepoints found using the PELT segmentation algorithm.
