Title: GenomeTrackSig - regional mutational signature profiling in cancer
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Caitlin Timmons, implemented with reference to TrackSig by Yulia Rubanova and TrackSigFreq by Cait Harrigan
Maintainer: Caitlin Timmons <ctimmons@smith.edu>
Description: GenomeTrackSig, to estimate regional variation in signatures
             of somatic mutational processes over large chromosomal domains. 
             GenomeTrackSig orders mutations by chromosomal location. GenomeTrackSig 
             segments mutation ordering by location and fits 
             signature exposures (activities) as a piece-wise constant function of the 
             mutation ordering. TrackSig uses optimal segmentation to find the points of
             change in signature activities.
